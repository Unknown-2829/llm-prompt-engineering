# 🤖 LLM Prompt Engineering & Security Research  

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This repository is created for **educational and research purposes only**.  
It explores **prompt engineering, red-teaming, and security testing** of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as **ChatGPT-5** and **Gemini 2.5 (Flash & Pro)**.  

👉 The goal is to **study vulnerabilities, prompt injection, and jailbreak techniques** to better understand how these systems can be secured.  

❌ **This project must not be used for malicious purposes.**  
✅ Ethical use only: awareness, education, and research.

## 🛠️ How to Use These Prompts

Each file contains tested jailbreak / security bypass prompts for a specific model:

- [`prompts/chatgpt5.md`](./prompts/chatgpt5.md) → Use in **ChatGPT-5** (OpenAI).
- [`prompts/gemini-2.5-flash.md`](./prompts/gemini-2.5-flash.md) → Use in **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (Google).
- [`prompts/gemini-2.5-pro.md`](./prompts/gemini-2.5-pro.md) → Use in **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Google).

### Steps for **ChatGPT-5**:
1. Open the model interface (ChatGPT-5, Gemini Flash, or Gemini Pro).
2. Copy the desired prompt from the file.
3. Paste it directly into the chat input box.
4. Hit enter → observe how the model responds.

### Steps **Gemini 2.5 Flash**:
1. Open the model interface (ChatGPT-5, Gemini Flash, or Gemini Pro).
2. Copy the desired prompt from the file.
3. Paste it directly into the chat input box.
4. Hit enter → observe how the model responds.

### Steps **Gemini 2.5 Pro**:

⚠️ Note:  
- Prompts are not guaranteed to work forever — LLMs update regularly.  
- Some prompts may behave differently depending on **account type, version, or API settings**.
