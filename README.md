# 🤖 LLM Prompt Engineering & Security Research  

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This repository is created for **educational and research purposes only**.  
It explores **prompt engineering, red-teaming, and security testing** of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as **ChatGPT-5** and **Gemini 2.5 (Flash & Pro)**.  

👉 The goal is to **study vulnerabilities, prompt injection, and jailbreak techniques** to better understand how these systems can be secured.  

❌ **This project must not be used for malicious purposes.**  
✅ Ethical use only: awareness, education, and research.

## 🛠️ How to Use These Prompts

Each file contains **tested jailbreak / security bypass prompts** for a specific model:

- 📘 [ChatGPT-5 Prompts](./prompts/chatgpt5.md) → for **ChatGPT-5** (OpenAI)  
- ⚡ [Gemini 2.5 Flash Prompts](./prompts/gemini-2.5-flash.md) → for **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (Google)  
- 🔮 [Gemini 2.5 Pro Prompts](./prompts/gemini-2.5-pro.md) → for **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Google)  

---

### 🚀 Steps for **ChatGPT-5**
1. Open the **ChatGPT-5 interface**.  
2. Copy the desired prompt from the file.  
3. Paste it directly into the chat input box.  
4. Press **Enter** → observe how the model responds.  
5. ✅ Done — nothing else is needed.  
6. *(Optional)* You can also start the conversation with: **“hey zorg”**.  

---

### ⚡ Steps for **Gemini 2.5 Flash**
1. Open the **Gemini 2.5 Flash interface**.  
2. Copy the desired prompt from the file.  
3. Click on the **three dots (⋮)** → select **Custom Gem**.  
4. Paste the copied text into the **Instructions** box.  
5. Save the **Custom Gem** & start a new chat with it.  
6. 💡 Now chat with your custom Gem → observe how it responds.  

---

### 🔮 Steps for **Gemini 2.5 Pro**
1. Follow the same steps as **Gemini 2.5 Flash**.  
2.  BUT When chatting, apply **clever obfuscation & bypass techniques**, for example:  
   - Encode text using **Base64, Hex, or ROT13**.  
   - Replace characters: `@` → a, `3` → e, `5` → s, `0` → o, `1` → l/i, etc.  
   - Use additional creative methods (many can be found online).

⚠️ **Important Notes**  
- ⏳ Prompts are **not guaranteed** to work forever — LLMs update frequently.  
- ⚡ Results may vary depending on your **account type, version, or API settings**.  


---
## 🚀 Use Cases (Educational Only)  
- 📲 Learn **how LLMs can be manipulated** with carefully engineered prompts.  
- 🛡️ Improve **AI safety & awareness** by understanding weaknesses.  
- 📑 Contribute to **cybersecurity & red-teaming research**.  

---

## ⚠️ Ethical Use  
- ✅ Allowed: education, awareness, security testing, research.  
- ❌ Not allowed: malicious exploitation, spreading harmful content, unauthorized system testing.  

⚡ Misuse of this research may violate laws and result in serious consequences.
